### `Reasons for this project`

Got this as an technical assignment originally, but that was kinda of a mess since there was a time limit and i put everything in one react component.

So i decided to rewrite the whole thing with redux to manage the game state.

Aswell as refactoring some functions here and there, tried to approach it with functional programming as much as i could.
